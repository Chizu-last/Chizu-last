<h3>
  
In case of panic, remember that the answer to all things of life and doubts is *

![Deep Thought](./assets/deep-thought-thinking.gif)

---

*'Protect me from knowing what I don't need to know. Protect me from even knowing that there are things to know that I don't know. Protect me from knowing that I decided not to know about the things that I decided not to know about. Amen.'
There's another prayer that goes with it that's very important. … 'Lord, lord, lord. Protect me from the consequences of the above prayer. Amen' 
And that's it. Most of the trouble people get into in life comes from leaving out that last part.*

</h3>
